# App
I tried writing a program which could take a audio from video calls or lectures and print it onto the screen.
I wanted to build this project so that these modules can be used for people with listening problem (Deaf People).

# modify the README.md file, or any other file

# add it and make a commit
git add REAME.md
git commit -m "update README"

# push the branch to remote, replace "<remote-repo>" with real repo name
git push <remote-repo> <branch>
# or
git push <remote-repo> <local-branch>:<remote-branch>
# eg
git push origin master
